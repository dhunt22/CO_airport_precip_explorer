# CO_airport_precip_explorer
A visualization of precipitation gauges and corresponding data from all airports in Colorado. Up to date data retrieved from ASOS, riem databases.

In this repository:
All data was collected and refined in "../data/in". 
Source code and .Rmd files are located in "../src".

I have separated the data gathering and manipulation from data visualization. I feel it is important to organize the .Rmd files in this manner to increase user readability.
