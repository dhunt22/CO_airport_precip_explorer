# Purpose

In this report, I will be exploring the precipitation at Northern Colorado Regional Airport. 
The data will be pulled from the ASOS station using the riem databases.

For this project, we want to organize our repository in a professional manner. A breakdown of this repository can be found in READMe.md.

## Credits
Initial project was inspired by Dr. Matt Ross of Colorado State University, who leads Intro to Environmental Data Science Applications: Water Resources.
